## What is tripplanner? and Why does it exist?

  Tripplanner was designed to be used as a tool of guidance in San Francisco and San Diego. Without a car and 
  no geographical familiarity of the area my girlfriend and I could use Tripplanner to give us a sense of location 
  as we traveled these big cities. Sense of location meaning that on any day and at any place on the trip we would 
  have a sense of direction, have knowledge of the area we were in and what we could spend our day doing there.


## What is tripplanner supposed to do?

  Prior to the trip we could add destinations we want to visit in these cities (restaurants, museums, beaches, 
  piers, popular streets) by saving the location, and important info about a destination. Then on the trip 
  while we are standing in the middle of a vast city with no clue where to go we open tripplanner and it automatically
  sorts our list of destinations by how far they are from our current location. The app provides the distance, 
  directions(transit,walking,driving), and info about each destination.
